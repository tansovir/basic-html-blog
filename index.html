			<h1><a href="">Time Machine Camera</a></h1>
			<img src="one.jpg" alt="post image" />
			<p>CES is a show. People organise it every year in Las Vegas. It shows new technology to people.

A new type of camera is at the CES this year. Its name is Roader. You wear the camera on your neck. When you press it, the camera sends a 20-second video to your phone. The video begins 10 seconds before you press the Roader! This means that you can never miss a moment.

You can buy the camera later this year. It costs 199 dollars.

Difficult words: CES (Consumer Electronics Show), press (push), miss (be too late to film).

You can watch the original video in the Level 3 section.</p>
